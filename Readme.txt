GNRTV . BLOCKS is a toolkit library programmed with Pd [pure-data] visual programming environment useful to build sonic generative applications in a straight-forward way. The idea inspired by the modular synth cosmos and othermodular tools features a big amount of different 'BLOCKS' that can be interconnected one from each other, therefore a toolkit for building custom projects oriented for live performances and installations. GNRTV.BLOCKS is a toolkit of abstractions that works with mostly all pd versions Pd vanilla, Pd-Extended, Pd-l2ork, and Purr-data.

Open GNRTV.BLOCKS.v1.0.l2ork.pd [ that u’ll find in 'code' folder if you are using pd-l2ork or purr-data ]
or
Open GNRTV.BLOCKS.v1.0.vanilla.pd [ that u’ll find in 'code' folder if you are using pdvanilla or extended ]

Note : Those are GNRTV.BLOCKS main Toolkit. You can also find the same blocks in another GUI :
GNRTV.BLOCKS.v1.0_Landscape.pd but somehow it crashes more than the subpatched versions
GNRTV.BLOCKS.v1.0.l2ork.pd and GNRTV.BLOCKS.v1.0.vanilla.pd

··················
Then
Follow the instructions in Tuto.GenerativeBlocks_v_ANG.pdf within ‘docs’ folder
AND / OR
detailed instructions for each blocks in code.HELP folder
(notice that are organized in several HELP patches like it are featured in GNRTV.BLOCKS main interface*)
*GNRTV.BLOCKS.v1.0.l2ork.pd or GNRTV.BLOCKS.v1.0.vanilla.pd
note : do not remove the rest of folders because maybe some blocks will not work properly.
The folder ‘projects’ is the one where you can save your projects. You can change its name if you prefer another one.
